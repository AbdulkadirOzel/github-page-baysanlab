Hello, I'm Gül Eda Aydemir, a passionate Computer Engineer from Istanbul, Turkey. Currently pursuing a remote Master's degree in Computer Engineering with a specialization in bioinformatics at Istanbul Technical University, I'm deeply interested in the fascinating world of genomics and the comparison of analysis tools' performance within different pipelines. Alongside my love for technology and research, I have practical experience working on the "CEPTETEB" banking mobile application with over 1.9 million active users. Besides, I indulge in creative pursuits like photography and 3D art. When not immersed in my studies or projects, I enjoy exploring new cuisines with friends, watching movies, and going on exciting road trips. I'm eager to bring my diverse skills, enthusiasm, and expertise in bioinformatics to new opportunities.
