I am a Yildiz Technical University graduate from the Computer Engineering department. I am doing my master's degree in Computer Engineering at ITU. I want to get new vision and techniques in bioinformatics. I will continue my work with high motivation and fulfill my duties as an active team member in innovative projects that will serve humanity. I want to discover human activity on cell perspective by AI.
