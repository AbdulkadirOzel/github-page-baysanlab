Hello! I’m Sinem. I received my bachelor’s degree from the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Üsküdar University and then completed my master's degree in Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics at Istanbul Medipol University. During my master's studies, I studied the field of computational biology and conducted molecular dynamics simulations of proteins. Concurrently, I successfully completed my thesis in the scope of structural bioinformatics.
During my master’s program, I developed a keen interest in NGS data analysis for clinical genetics. This background has been the basis for my position as a Bioinformatician at Istanbul Medipol University Genetic Diseases Assessment Center since 2020. With my current status, my academic interests lie in clinical bioinformatics and genomics studies.
