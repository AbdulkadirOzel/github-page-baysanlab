I am a research assistant in Computer Engineering Department of Istanbul Technical University. I received my master's degree in Computer Engineering from Istanbul Technical University in 2019 and I am a PhD student in the same department. I am interested in applying and developing machine learning methods for the optimization of the  somatic mutation detection pipeline.
