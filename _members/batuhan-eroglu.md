I am Batuhan Eroğlu, and a 3rd year undergraduate computer engineering student at Ankara University. I have been interested in bioinformatics for a while. My introduction to bioinformatics started with Teknofest Artificial Intelligence in Health Competition. During this competition, I gained a lot of knowledge and experience in the field of bioinformatics and this is how I became interested in it. One of the my aims is to advance and specialize in bioinformatics, and to realize this goal, I joined the BaysanLab, where I am going to improve myself thanks to various studies and projects.
