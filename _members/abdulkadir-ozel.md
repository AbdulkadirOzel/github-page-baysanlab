Hi, I’m Abdulkadir Özel. I’m currently a Master’s Degree student at Istanbul Technical University in the Molecular Biology-Genetics & Biotechnology programme. I got my bachelor's degree from the same department and university in February 2022. Although my background education is based on molecular biology and genetics, I have a special interest in bioinformatics. That's why I continue my graduate studies at Baysan Lab. My research interests are genomics, transcriptomics and comparison of the analysis tools’ performance within different pipelines.
