I have a BA in International Trade and Management (with Minor in Computer Science) and MSc in Data Science from Istanbul Sehir University. My research interests are clinical bioinformatics and cancer genomics. I am interested in analyzing NGS datasets to find prognostic markers, to model tumor evolution, or to understand tumor heterogeneity.
