Hello, I am Abdullah. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering at Istanbul Technical University where I also earned my bachelor's degree in the same field. My primary interest is software development. I was introduced to bioinformatics through BaysanLab during my undergraduate studies. My work in the lab focuses on application development related to bioinformatics.
