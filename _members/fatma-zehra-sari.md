Hello, I am F. Zehra Sari. I completed my undergraduate studies in the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department at Gebze Technical University, and I am currently pursuing an integrated doctorate program in Synthetics and Systems Biotechnology at the same university. My research is centered around gaining a comprehensive understanding of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria through the utilization of transcriptome data and genome-scale metabolic models.

From the early stages of my academic journey, starting in high school, I have actively engaged in various scientific projects. Recently, I furthered my expertise by undergoing specialized training in Data Science and Engineering at Istanbul Data Science Academy. As of now, I am expanding my knowledge in the field of NGS data generation, processing, and interpretation.
