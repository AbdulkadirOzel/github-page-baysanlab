Hello, I'm Büşra Nur Darendeli Kiraz, a Bioengineering graduate with a double major in Molecular Biology and Genetics and a Bachelor's degree from Yıldız Technical University (YTU). I pursued my Master's degree in Bioengineering from YTU, specializing in using convolutional neural networks to explore cancer biomarkers.

Currently, I am pursuing a doctorate in Bioengineering at YTU, with a focus on bioinformatic analysis. During my Master's program, I had the opportunity to work on a project related to antibiotic resistance and evolution. In this project, I contributed to the identification of potential antibiotic candidates that delayed resistance. Additionally, I gained experience as a lab manager, overseeing laboratory establishment and operations.

My dedication to scientific research and interest in bioinformatics drives my desire to continue making contributions to the field. I am enthusiastic about exploring computational analysis and furthering our understanding of biological processes.
