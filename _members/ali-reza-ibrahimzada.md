I am a CS PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, IL, United States. My research interests include LLMs for Code, Code Translation, Software Testing, Program Analysis, and Deep Learning. Moreover, I am a member of the Intelligent CAT Lab advised by Prof. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand since Fall 2022.

Previously, I was a Visiting Scholar at IBM Research - IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States in Summer 2023. I was mainly working on Programming Language Translation using LLMs.

Feel free to send me an email if you are interested in my research.
