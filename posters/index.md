# ITU BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH GROUP

Welcome to the Bioinformatics Research Group at ITU. This group combines the efforts of Assoc. Prof. Mehmet BAYSAN (Baysan Lab) and Assoc. Prof. Ali ÇAKMAK (Çakmak Lab).  Baysan Lab and Çakmak Lab consist of graduate and undergraduate research students and faculty mostly from Computer Science Department. However, due to the interdisciplinary nature of our research, we also collaborate with researchers from other domains, such as biology, genetics, and medicine.

Bioinformatics: We develop computational models and automated analysis methods for biological data. In particular, we focus on biochemical interactions (enzyme-enzyme and enzyme-metabolite) and metabolomics.

Data mining, data management, databases: We develop data mining and management algorithms to automatically predict variety of data pieces in diverse applications that range from predicting high impact scientific papers to mining graph and text patterns in biomedical databases.
