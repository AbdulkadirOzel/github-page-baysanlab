# Ã‡akmak Lab

Our group focuses on mining, computational analysis, and management of data in different fields with a special focus on biological and health data. Hence, our research is mostly interdisciplinary spanning diverse fields including algorithm development, systems biology, medical informatics, and databases. In particular, we develop methods and tools to study high throuhput biological and clinical datasets with the broader goal of understading diseases with their underlying mechanisms. To this end, we employ and develop techniques from data science and machine learning to create models for personalized medicine applications.
