# Mining for Unknown Pathways

Many essential biological pathways still remain unknown or incomplete for newly sequenced organisms. Moreover, experimental validation of enormous numbers of possible pathway candidates in a wet-lab environment is time and effort-extensive. In this research, we developed comparative genomics tools and algorithms (Cakmak and Ozsoyoglu, 2007a; Cakmak et al., 2007; Ratprasartporn et al., 2006; Cakmak and Ozsoyoglu, 2008a) that help scientists predict pathways in an organismâ€™s metabolic network (with 86% precision and 74% recall).
