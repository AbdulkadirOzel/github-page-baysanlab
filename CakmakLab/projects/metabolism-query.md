# Metabolism Query Language

In another research, we designed a “metabolism query language” (MQL) (Cakmak et al., 2010; Cakmak et al., 2012; Cicek et al. 2014) that computationally captures the metabolism data and allows to query it at a detailed level. MQL accommodates metabolic network knowledge in a manner faithful to the underlying biochemistry. We also solve and present query processing techniques for MQL queries.
