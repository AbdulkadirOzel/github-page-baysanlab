## Highlights

{% capture text %}

There are many projects carried out by our lab together. One of the prominent projects is the Comparative Sequencing Analysis Platform (CoSAP). CoSAP is an easy yet comprehensive pipeline creation tool for NGS data. It provides reproducibility and aims to give deeper insight about the powers and limitations of the current tools by allowing users to compare results of different pipelines.
