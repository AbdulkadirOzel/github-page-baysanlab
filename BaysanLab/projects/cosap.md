# Comparative Sequencing Analysis Platform

CoSAP is an easy yet comprehensive pipeline creation tool for NGS data. It provides reproducibility and aims to give deeper insight about the powers and limitations of the current tools by allowing users to compare results of different pipelines.

A typical variant calling pipeline consists of Read Trimming, Read Mapping, Duplicate Removal&Base Calibration, Variant Calling and Variant Annotation steps. CoSAP provides several tool options for each of these steps.
